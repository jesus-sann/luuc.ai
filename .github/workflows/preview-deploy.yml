  # Note: Actual Vercel deployment is handled by Vercel's GitHub integration
  # This workflow just provides additional context
  # To enable Vercel previews:
  # 1. Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
  # 2. Vercel will automatically deploy previews for all PRs
  # 3. Environment variables must be configured in Vercel dashboard
